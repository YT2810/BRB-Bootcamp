Introduction:

Hello everyone, my name is Yolfry, and I'm here to present Fractls-DApp, a decentralized application designed to create and manage fractionalized NFTs. Our platform offers a unique experience for both artists and users by combining the world of NFTs with a puzzle-like gaming interface.

Quick Overview:

Fractls-DApp allows artists to mint an original NFT along with nine fractional NFTs. Users can buy, trade, and assemble these fractional NFTs. The owner of all nine fractions can claim the original NFT, adding an engaging twist to the traditional NFT experience.
